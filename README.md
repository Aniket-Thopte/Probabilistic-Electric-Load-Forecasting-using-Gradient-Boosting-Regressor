# Probabilistic-Electric-Load-Forecasting-using-Gradient-Boosting-Regressor

• The problem statement deals with hourly probabilistic electric load forecasting. We have been given dataset of 5 years on hourly basis. We need to provide 9 percentiles (10,20,…..,90) for the electric load for one full year on hourly basis.

• The forecasting model is built using Gradient Boosting Regressor technique.

• The model runs effectively producing 9 different percentile intervals.

# Applications: 
• Demand, Weather, Economic, Energy, Population Forecasting, Sports Betting, etc.
